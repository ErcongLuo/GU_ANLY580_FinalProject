"312","@Toky02 Interesting. The J&amp;J vaccine, while falling short of the others in antibodies, was shown to apparently have a good T-cell response. (I read the studies pretty closely because I got J&amp;J in the US in late May.)",2021-11-28 08:55:31,0

"314","@ProudlyCentrist South Africa had to ask J&amp;J and Phizer to delay more shipments of the vaccine  because they had too much in stock due to hesitancy.

Botswana, where it was also initially found, has close to the same vaccination rate as South Africa.",2021-11-28 03:20:02,0
"315","My husband @JerickFL and I just got our COVID vaccine boosters at @cvspharmacy! @CDCgov now recommends adults 18+ get boosted 6 months after Pfizer/Moderna’s two-part vaccine or 2 months after J &amp; J! 💉🦠 

More short-term COVID antibodies = more protection during the holidays!🎄 https://t.co/FlC6X6kn9a",2021-11-27 21:29:42,0
"316","Days before Omicron was announced S. Africa halted their vaccine orders from Pfizer due to lack of interest by its citizens.

Suddenly there’s a new variant originating from the region and travel is banned.

"317","Is Omicron more severe than Delta or other variants? 
We don’t know yet. There have been breakthrough infections in South Africa among people who have received the J&amp;J, Pfizer–BioNTech and Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccines. Two in Hong Kong reportedly had Pfizer vaccine.9/14",2021-11-27 18:24:31,0

"319","@RebeccaReal6 Depends on which vaccine they received and when. Remember that SA was an early adopter of the J&amp;J, and that vaccine is only about 70% effective against hospitalization. About 1 in 3 vaccinated adults in SA have taken J&amp;J. (It’s about 1 in 4 in Gauteng). https://t.co/8rphxRDV6K",2021-11-27 15:40:50,0
